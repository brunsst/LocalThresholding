# LocalThresholding
Performs locally adaptive Otsu thresholding on 3D image sequences of tomographic reconstructions

### Compilation

Required libraries are LibTiff and OpenMP. The source code should compile on most Linux distributions by running: 

***<p align="center"> sh build_localthresholding.sh </p>***

which will provide an executable *locthresh* in the same directory.
